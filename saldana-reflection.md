#GPS 1.1 Reflection

###1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I think I was pretty ok with git in this session because I had used these commands a few times before but I kept doing things like forgetting to change directories which caused some confusion. 

###2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I'm going to have to agree with Daniel on this one and say I didnt know anything about adding assignees to a repo prior to this session.

###3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked my pair about markdown syntax and how to get our photo to show up in the remote repo. I was confused for a bit and kept thinking I needed to link to the photo in google drive or something.
I asked the guide about changing permissions on a remote repo but I think I was getting a little ahead of myself.

###4. What still confuses you about git?

I'm confused as to why I would ever want to fetch and merge when I can just use pull.

###5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was great. I was a little nervous going into it but my pair and guide were very laid back and I relaxed immediately.
