#GPS 1.1 Reflection

###- What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I didn't quite have a firm grasp of what `git fetch` and `git merge` did exactly. I'd seen them, but I'd never really tried using them since `git pull` did basically all the same work.

###- What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I don't think I even knew about it before the GPS, but adding assignees was clarified for me. It's what you do when you want someone to do joint work with you on a project. The assignee can see your pushes and easily review your commits.

###- What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked for clarification on some commands as well as what some of the options on GitHub did. I also asked for his help understanding why our merge conflict at the end didn't seem to work properly. It turned out I was in the wrong directory.

###- What still confuses you about git?

What confuses me about git are some of the options. I feel as though I have a good grasp of the workflow we've been using, but there's still a lot of buttons and such that I really don't know anything about. I'd like to play around some time, but I might need someone to help explain what's going on...

###- How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I had a good time. It was nice to put our knowledge to the test, and it's always enjoyable to successfully finish a challenge. My partner was really cool, and I think we did well.
